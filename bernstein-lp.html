        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Erasure is an English synth-pop duo formed in London in 1985, consisting of
          singer/songwriter Andy Bell with songwriter, producer and keyboardist Vince Clarke, previously known as
          co-founder of the band Depeche Mode and a member of electropop duo Yazoo. From their fourth single,
          "Sometimes" (1986), Erasure established themselves on the UK Singles Chart, becoming one of the most
          successful acts of the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. From 1986 to 2007, the pair achieved 24 consecutive top-40
          entries in the UK singles chart. By 2009, 34 of their 37 chart-eligible singles and EPs had made the UK top
          40, including 17 climbing into the top 10. At the 1989 Brit Awards, Erasure won the Brit Award for Best
          British Group. Beyond this mainstream commercial success, Erasure are also popular within the LGBT community,
          for whom the openly gay singer Andy Bell has become an icon in the UK.[5] </p>
        <p>Marking one of the first touring campaigns out of the gates post-lockdown, The Neon Tour – announced
          following the release of Erasure’s 18th studio album – celebrated a return to some semblance of normality for
          the live events sector in the UK. Having steadily toured the globe and released new music over the past 36
          years, the British synthpop duo have experienced somewhat of a career renaissance in recent years, making a
          step back up to large-scale shows reminiscent of their early commercial success. Despite the growing
          popularity of the band, their cult following and DIY ethos remains as relevant as ever, as TPi discovered when
          chatting to their core touring crew.</p>
        <p>Achieving mainstream success at home in the UK, Erasure also has a strong following abroad, especially in
          some European countries—mainly in Ireland, Germany, Austria, Denmark and Sweden. Surprisingly, Erasure has a
          broad audience in a few South American countries, especially in Argentina, Chile and Peru. In the US, Erasure
          had three successful singles: "Chains of Love" (1988) at number 12, their biggest chart placing ever in that
          country, "A Little Respect" (1988) at number 14, and "Always" (1994) at number 20. In Russia, as well as in
          the former Soviet bloc countries, Erasure is mostly known for the sole song "Love to Hate You" (1991). In
          France, "Oh L'amour" (1986) was the band's only successful single, peaking at number 14 in the singles top 50
          of that country, followed by "Sometimes" (1986) that underperformed at a low number 39 (in February 1987) and
          still remains to this day Erasure's last entry in the French singles chart. </p>
        <p>Overall in their career, Erasure have penned over 200 songs and have sold over 28 million albums
          worldwide. Erasure is coming to North America, including the US and Canada this January, marking the first
          time the duo would perform in the Americas in over 3 years. Consult the below list to see available dates this
          month.
